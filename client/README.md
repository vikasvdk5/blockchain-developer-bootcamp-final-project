# Getting Started with NFTCosmos

The NFTCosmos app is a full-fledged application on the Ethereum blockchain for listing and selling ethereum based NFTs with royalty.

>A royalty payment is a payment made by one party to another that owns a particular asset, for the right to ongoing use of that asset. Royalties are typically agreed upon as a percentage of gross or net revenues derived from the use of an asset or a fixed price per unit sold of an item of such, but there are also other modes and metrics of compensation.A royalty interest is the right to collect a stream of future royalty payments.`


# Features
-  User can mint an NFT by uploading an art and specify the royalty type
    -  ***Creator Royalty*** : The creator of the NFT gets royalty each time it has been transfered from one user to another using the platform.
    -  ***No Royalty*** : The creator can forgo the royalty so the user doesnt get royalty each time the NFT is trrasnferred.
